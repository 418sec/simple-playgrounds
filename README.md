# Coordinates, shapes of environments

Carthesian coordinate system:
- x along the horizontal axis
- y along the vertical axis
- theta orientation, aligned on horizontal axis


Environment:
- room shape and size: [width, length]
- width along x axis, length along y axis

Entities:
- coordinates x, y
- orientation phi
- length along axis of phi = 0
- width perpendicular to axis phi = 0

Todo: add drawing to summarize coordinate system
